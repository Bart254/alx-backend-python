# Python Variable Annotations

## Overview

This folder contains solutions for the variable annotation project in Alx's curriculum.
It focuses on how to use built-in types, function and duck annotations. As per the requirements,
Mypy is used to validate all code, pycodestyle 3.7 used for styling and python3 version 3.8
used as the default interpreter.
